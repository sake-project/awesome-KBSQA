## datasets

### WebQuestions

https://github.com/brmson/dataset-factoid-webquestions or
https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sempre/

It consists of few thousands human-annotated questions, matched with answers corresponding to entities of Freebase. (no triple has to be returned, only a single entity). It was first used by Bordes et al. (2014b).

### SimpleQuestions

https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/BuboQA-data/raw/master/SimpleQuestions_v2.tgz or
https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/

The SimpleQuestions dataset consists of a total of 108,442 questions written in natural language by human English-speaking annotators each paired with a corresponding fact, formatted as (subject, relationship, object), that provides the answer but also a complete explanation. Facts have been extracted from the Knowledge Base Freebase. The authors randomly shuffle these questions and use 70% of them (75910) as training set, 10% as validation set (10845), and the remaining 20% as test set.

#### FB2M and FB5M subsets

`/SimpleQuestions_v2/freebase-subsets/`

FB2M contains about 2M entities and 5k relationships. FB5M, is much larger with about 5M entities and more than 7.5k relationships. They were first used by Bordes et al. (2014a).

- [PDF](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_11.pdf)
- CODE
- METHODOLOGY: `Both the question and the KB triple are embedded as a $k$-dimensional vector and compared based on inner product. In particular, each question token and each KB entity/predicate is learned as $k$-dimensional and the embeddings of questions and KB triples are summed based on their presences.`
- REMARKS:
  - questions can be regarded as a bag of words.
  - large question-answer datasets are generated by templates and their paraphrase to more types of questions are preserved by a multitask learning process over PARALEX dataset.
